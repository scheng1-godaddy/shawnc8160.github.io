#Project 1 - Connect 4
For GA WDI Project 1, I created a connect 4 game

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, JS with Jquery library (along with the jquery UI package for draggable method)

## Link to the game:
[Link](https://shawnc8160.github.io/project1/)

## Installation Instructions
Only tested with Chrome, so use that. 

## Instructions
Choose the emoticon you want, choose the grid size, then start the game. 

Players must drag the chip above the board to drop into columns. Connect 4 chips in a row (with the same color) to win the game. You can connect horizontally, vertically and diagonally. There's a button to reset the board. 

## Unsolved issues
Will come back to this after further testing
